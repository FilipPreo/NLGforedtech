This project aims to build on previous work done by various researchers on the Stanford Questions and Answers Dataset (SQuAD2.0). Normally the input variables would be a a corpus (many sections of text) from Wikipedia with some questions written about each document in the corpus; the target variable is the answer to the question (or in the case of unanswerable questions, a response stating that the question cannot be answered). The first goal of this project is to build a sufficiently robust learner that is comparable in performance with some of the lower-performing other learners displayed on the SQuAD leaderboard, as a baseline. The second goal is a learner that delivers one correct answer and at least four relatively plausible but distinct answers, so these can be used in an automatic multi-choice question generating framework for an educational platform. The third and most audacious goal of the project is to generate questions directly from a section of the document. In this case the input features would be the document and a series of answers; the target variable would be the questions. This Natural Language Generation process has been achieved before in the research literature but is likely to be significantly more challenging than the other goals.
